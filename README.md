# CS 300 Portfolio Submission

## Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The projects focused on developing software to help academic advisors at ABC University manage and access course information efficiently. Specifically, I needed to design and implement algorithms that could load course data, store it in appropriate data structures, and print a list of courses in alphanumeric order, along with their prerequisites.

### How did you approach the problem?
I started by analyzing different data structures—vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees—to determine which would best balance runtime efficiency and memory usage. Understanding data structures was key to selecting the right tools for storing and retrieving data quickly. I designed pseudocode for each approach, evaluated their runtime and memory tradeoffs, and finally implemented the most efficient one in C++.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered?
One challenge I faced was handling file input and parsing data correctly, especially ensuring the program could detect format errors. I overcame this by testing the code incrementally—first confirming file access, then line parsing, and finally storing each course correctly in the data structure. I also used debugging outputs and documentation to verify my logic step-by-step.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project taught me how important planning and pseudocode are before writing any code. I learned to analyze problems through algorithm design and efficiency, which improved my ability to design software that’s both functional and optimized. It also reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in program design.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I now focus on writing code that others can easily understand and modify. I used clear naming conventions, modular functions, and comments to make the code maintainable. This project also encouraged me to consider scalability and flexibility so the program could handle larger datasets or new features in the future.
